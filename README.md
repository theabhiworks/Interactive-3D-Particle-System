# Interactive-3D-Particle-System

Built with Three.js + AI + Hand Tracking

This project is a real-time interactive 3D particle system powered by Three.js, gesture recognition, and modern browser APIs.
You can control particle behavior using hand gestures through your camera — expansion, color shifts, particle shape transitions, and more.

The entire project was generated from a single prompt using Google AI Studio, showcasing how powerful and creative AI-assisted coding has become.

#✨ Features

🎥 Camera-based hand gesture control

🌈 Dynamic color transitions

🎆 Multiple particle templates: hearts, flowers, Saturn, fireworks, and more

🔄 Real-time particle transformations

⚡ Smooth 3D rendering using WebGL + Three.js

📁 All in a single file (HTML + JS + CSS inline)

🖥 Works directly in the browser — no backend required

#🧠 Why This Project?

This project is a small example of how AI is transforming creative coding.
With just one natural language prompt, AI generated a fully working interactive 3D system — something that normally takes days of development.

AI isn’t replacing developers — it’s supercharging our creativity.
